## Nero Siva

I am an aspiring Web Developer currently enrolled at one of the leading coding bootcamps in Europe, Makers Academy. As a graduate Mechanical Engineer with four years of Sales & Account Management experience, I am looking to apply my diverse skill set as Junior Web Developer.

## Skills

#### Quick Learner

Soon after graduating with a 2:1 in Mechanical Engineering, I came to the realisation that though my problem-solving skills had been challenged on a daily basis for years on end, I needed to improve my communication and interpersonal skills. After initially struggling to adapt to a job that required a different skillset to what I had spent years building, I soon decided to dedicate my spare time to research Sales techniques and read books that would help me overcome my fear of pitching a complete stranger. This extra-curricular dedication lead to my promotion to the top sales team within three months of my first day in the Sales industry.  

#### Strong team-worker 

To build on the skills I developed by working in sales, I decided to pursue a role as an Account Executive at one of the country's leading Market Research businesses, Kantar Media - Consumer Intelligence. I joined the Media Owners team who were responsible for supplying over 100 Media Owners in Britain & Ireland with syndicated market research for brand positioning, supporting sales stories and general market analysis. As an Account Executive on the team, I was exposed to a variety of small start-ups such as Admedia to large tech businesses such as Amazon and Twitter. Once again, within three months I had impressed my team to such an extent that I was trusted to train clients by myself and tasked with renewing contracts cumulatively worth in excess of £250,000. Working in a high-pressure environment with a Account Management team from diverse backgrounds enabled me to learn how to work in a team to reach a common goal. Furthermore, my market research knowledge lead to clients requesting that I assist in-house Insight teams on a regular basis in order to tackle complex briefs.
