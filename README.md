I am an aspiring Software Developer and recent graduate one of the leading coding bootcamps in Europe, Makers Academy. As a graduate Mechanical Engineer with four years of Sales & Account Management experience, I am seeking an opportunity to apply my diverse skill set as Junior Software Developer. My time on the intensive programming course has instilled a core framework of processes and skills including, but not limited to, regular pair-programming, TDD & BDD (Test and Behaviour Driven Development) and strong XP values.

## Projects

|:--------:|:----|:--------------|
|[Layman Brothers](https://github.com/neroshan12/laymanbrothers)| For our final project at Makers Academy, our group decided to challenge ourselves by learning a completely new tech stack in order to create a Digital Banking Web Application. Immersing myself in all aspects of the project in order to expose myself to the front and back-end, I was keen to stick to the core principles that I have been exposed to in the past 12 weeks. I arranged regular stand-ups & retros to ensure the team were focused on the task at hand and maintained a clear line of communication between all members of the team. | Java, Spring Boot, Maven, PostgreSQL, Spring JPA, HTML, CSS and Thymeleaf. Testing: JUnit and Selenium. |
|[Attractour](https://github.com/neroshan12/practice-project)| For a practice project, our group decided to develop a web application that allows users to see their distance from predetermined points of interest and the MVP was created within a week. The project allowed us to experiment with a variety of techniques that we had been learning throughout the bootcamp and gave me the opportunity to teach myself how to style with HTML, CSS & Bootstrap.   | JavaScript, HTML, CSS & Bootstrap. |
|[EarBnb](https://github.com/neroshan12/EarBnb)| I project managed a group of three to create a clone of Airbnb. We used the week as an exercise to learn how to develop software in a team using Agile methodology and XP values whilst applying our Ruby and Sinatra knowledge. | Ruby, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Testing: RSpec and Capybara |
